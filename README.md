This Colab notebook is designed to help me learn and experiment with Google's Vertex AI, specifically focusing on AutoML pipelines. This notebook is inspired by the excellent tutorials from Mike Henderson, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgxF613RsGoUuEjJJxJW2JYyZ8g1qOUou). 

The primary goal of this notebook is to explore and understand the tools and features provided by Google Vertex AI, rather than to conduct a deep dive into data analysis. To keep things straightforward and focused on the technology, I decided to use the well-known [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle.
