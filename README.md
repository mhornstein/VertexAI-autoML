# Exploring AutoML with Google Vertex AI

This repository was created to explore Google Vertex AI's AutoML capabilities. After considering both Azure Machine Learning and Vertex AI, I chose Vertex AI, inspired by Mike Henderson's excellent tutorial.

In this project, I used a different dataset from the one in the tutorial to evaluate AutoML with both the Python Client and Pipelines. The repository includes two notebooks, each demonstrating one of these approaches.

The primary focus is on understanding Vertex AI's tools and features, rather than in-depth data analysis of the dataset at hand.

## Requirements

- Enable Vertex AI and BigQuery APIs in your Google Cloud project.
- Notebooks were executed in Vertex AI Workbench.

## Dataset

- **[Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn?resource=download)**
